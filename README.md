# UFOs

## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

For our client, Dana, a webpage and dynamic table were created to allow users to filter through a vast database of information on UFO sightings. Users are able to filter through data based on date, city, state, country, duration of the encounter and even UFO shape!

## RESULTS

A visually engaging webpage with dynamic tables for users to search for UFO sightings in their area by date!! These searches can be tailored to search an area by Country, State / Province and City. Users can also opt to search Date alone as well the Shape of the UFO.

## SUMMARY

In summary, one drawback of this design is that there area some errors and inconsistencies in the dataset. The following recommendations could benefit this webpage and design; a function where users can upload their own experiences and the addition of UFO photos to the dataset.
